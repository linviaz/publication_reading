## Better data -> better results

The authors conducted a comparative study on model performance of a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) with deep neural network (DNN) models on nine datasets with window-based input transformation. They found that the window-based input transformation boosted the performance of a simple GBRT model to levels that outperformed all SOTA DNN models evaluated in the paper. 

Check [this reference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06902.pdf) for that the accomplishments of deep learning approaches in various research segments of machine learning, need to be regularly affirmed and assessed against simple, but effective models to maintain the authenticity of the progression in the respective field of research.
