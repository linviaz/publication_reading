## Terms

 - ECS: Equilibrium climate sensitivity: the global mean warming that would occur if the atmospheric CO2 concentration were instantly doubled and the climate were then brought to equilibrium with that new level of CO2.
 - IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
 - ECS in terms of stabilization of global warming relative to the preindustrial climate: 1.5-4.5 degrees Celsius for more than 25 years. 
 - Paris Agreement upper limit: 2 degrees Celsius of global warming.
 - Radiative forcing (or climate forcing): is the change in energy flux in the atmosphere caused by natural or anthopogenic factors of climate change as measured by watts/meter. 

## Constrain ECS Background

Two approaches to constrain ECS:
 - using the record of historical warming
 - reconstructions of past climates

Both suffer from large uncertainties in the reconstruction of net radiative forcing. 

Alternatively, the emergent constraint (EC) approach uses an ensemble of complete Earth System Models (ESMs) to estimate the relationship between a modelled but observable variation in the Earth system and a predicted future change. 

## An Emergent Constraint on ECS

The EC on ECS was proposed based on the variability of global-mean temperature. 

### Global Temperature as a Constraint

Starting from the simple 'Hasselmann model' for the variation in global mean temperature $\Delta T$ in response to radiative forcing `Q`:

$$
C \frac{\d \Delta T}{\d t} = Q - \lambda \Delta T = N
$$

where:
C = the constant heat capacity is a simplication that is known to be a poor representation of ocean heat uptake on longer timescales.
$\lambda$ = the climate feedback factor, determines how the net top-of-atmosphere planetary energy balance N varies with temperature change $\Delta T$ in response to a radiative forcing change Q. $\lambda$ varies from $0.6 W m^{-2} K^{-1}$ to $1.8 W m^{-2} K^{-1}$.

Both models with high and low climate feedback factor sensitivities can reproduce historical global warming. Thus, the fit to the global temperature record does not provie a direct constraint on ECS.

### Variability as a Constraint

De-trend the global mean temperature records from the models and the observations to test whether variability is a better constraint on ECS. 

The de-trend approach was informed by techniques designd to detect precursors of potential tipping points, such as 'critical slowing down', using a moving window to:
 - linearly de-trend within the window
 - then calulate statistics of the de-trended residuals

The global mean temperature (moving avg of 55\,yr window) from the observational data were found to be within the range of the lower-sensitivity models but outside the range of the higher-sensitivity models.

The choice of window width was informed by sensitivity studies in which the emergent constraint was calculated for a range of the parameter. 55yr was found to be the window length that optimally separates foced trend from variability.
